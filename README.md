### CSV comparison tool

This application concerns a tool to compare numeric time series data in CSV format. The tool was particularly finetuned to work with CSV files generated by HWiNFO64. It has however been adapted to broadly accept time series data on different time scopes. 

#### The process
* The application ingests two csv files with (mostly) identical variables
* If ingested correctly, the CSV header will be translated into all its respective variables
* The user selects a variable for the X-axis (usually time) and is then prompted to choose which variables to plot in this timeseries
* Plots can be generated in a side-by-side or combined fashion
* The user can opt to generate a PDF report or download all individual plots as .PNG images (custom aspect ratios)

#### Data sources
* The user can upload their own .CSV files (further finetuning might be required for specific usecases)
* The user can opt to use a pair of demo files

#### Application limitations
* Developed for numeric data (categorical variable distribution currently unavailable)
* Only positive numeric values will currently be plotted
* Some date/time formats might not be recognized appropriately, so far it does however seem somewhat robust
